      <!-- Overview -->
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Barber School Management System is a full-featured web application that digitizes and streamlines all aspects of barber school operations. This system replaces multiple disconnected tools with a single, cohesive platform that manages the entire student lifecycle, from initial lead to graduation and beyond. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As the solo developer on this project, I was responsible for the entire process - from requirements gathering and system design to front-end implementation, back-end architecture, and deployment.
