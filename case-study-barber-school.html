      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Barber School Management Application is designed to streamline operations for a local barber school.
        It helps manage leads, track student progress, and centralize administrative tasks.
        This project leverages modern technologies like Nuxt 3, a Postgres backend via Supabase, and a component-driven approach documented through Storybook.
