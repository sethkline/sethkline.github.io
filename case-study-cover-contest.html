      <!-- Overview -->
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Cover Design Contest Platform is a full-stack application built to streamline the submission, 
        management, and judging of art contests. Designed with flexibility in mind, the system handles 
        different contest types (cover designs and bookmarks) across multiple age categories, providing 
        both an intuitive administrative interface and a seamless judging experience.
      </p>

      <!-- Challenge -->
      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Managing art contests traditionally involves manual handling of physical submissions and paper-based 
        scoring systems that are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Time-consuming to process and organize</li>
        <li>Difficult to track and manage consistently</li>
        <li>Prone to scoring inconsistencies across multiple judges</li>
        <li>Challenging to organize by age categories and contest types</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The client needed a solution to digitize this process while maintaining the integrity of judging and 
        providing accurate management of all submissions.
      </p>

      <!-- Process & Design -->
      <h2>Process & Design</h2>
      <div class="process-section">
        <h3>Research & Planning</h3>
        <p>
          I began by mapping the existing workflow and identifying key stakeholders:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contest administrators who manage submissions</li>
          <li>Judges who score the entries</li>
          <li>Participants whose work is being evaluated</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After analyzing these needs, I developed a database schema that would provide the necessary structure 
          while remaining flexible enough to accommodate different contest types.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-section">
        <h3>Database Design</h3>
        <p>
          I designed a relational database with PostgreSQL (via Supabase) that includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contests table for tracking different types of competitions</li>
          <li>Age categories to organize participants appropriately</li>
          <li>Entries table that captures participant information and submission images</li>
          <li>Judges table integrated with authentication system</li>
          <li>Scores table with appropriate criteria metrics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The database includes proper security measures with row-level security policies to ensure judges 
          and administrators have appropriate access levels.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-section">
        <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
        <p>
          I created two distinct interfaces:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Admin Interface:</strong> Focused on efficient entry management and judge coordination, 
            with intuitive forms for adding new entries and tracking judge participation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Judge Interface:</strong> Designed for distraction-free evaluation with intuitive scoring 
            controls, image zoom capabilities, and keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation between entries.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="challenge-solution">
        <h3>Image Handling</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Challenge:</strong> Handling high-resolution artwork images efficiently while providing zoom functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Implemented progressive loading with state management for smooth transitions 
          between images. Added zoom controls with keyboard shortcuts for intuitive navigation.

      <div class="challenge-solution">
        <h3>Fair Judging Process</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Challenge:</strong> Ensuring consistent scoring across multiple judges and preventing bias.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Designed a standardized scoring system with clear criteria (creativity, 
          execution, impact) on a 0-10 scale. Implemented database constraints to prevent duplicate 
          scoring from the same judge.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="challenge-solution">
        <h3>Security & Access Control</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Challenge:</strong> Maintaining appropriate access levels between administrators and judges.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Implemented granular row-level security policies in Supabase to ensure 
          judges could only submit their own scores while viewing all entries, and administrators had 
          full control over contest management.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Results & Impact -->
      <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
